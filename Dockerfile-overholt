# NOTE: Baseimage python:2.7 already contains latest pip

# TODO: Compile cryptography (and everything else pip related) elsewhere and 
# get rid of "build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev"
# Maybe according to these instructions: 
# https://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/2015/03/docker-deploy-double-dutch.html

# TODO: Double check and think about the order of commands. Should application 
# specific stuff be moved to the end of the file? 
# What are actually application specific? etc.

# TODO: Have brainstorming session on how to properly setup EXPOSE ports, hosts, etc.
# Now it is difficult to come up with sensible defaults.
# Remember to check out what Docker Compose offers.

# TODO: Make a new user and usergroup.
# Now everything including the ENTRYPOINT is being run as root which is bad
# practise and for example uWSGI complains about this.

###
# Install 
# Specific structure where a single RUN is used to execute everything.
# Based on Docker Best practices -document. To force cache busting.
# https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/#/apt-get
# NOTE: python-mysql.connector is MyData Account specific dependency.

# Install application specific Python-dependencies.

# NOTE: If you have multiple Dockerfile steps that use different files from 
# your context, COPY them individually, rather than all at once. This will 
# ensure that each stepâ€™s build cache is only invalidated (forcing the step 
# to be re-run) if the specifically required files change.
