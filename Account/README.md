# MyData Account
MyData Account is a part of MyData SDK implementation of MyData Architecture - Consent Based Approach for Personal Data Management.

## Introduction
MyData Account is a key enabler in service linking and data flow authorisation. It stores all Account  Ownerâ€™s service links and consents along with their history in a single place. This helps provide a unified view to all data flow authorizations and it enables the Account Owner to manage and control the authorized data flows.
